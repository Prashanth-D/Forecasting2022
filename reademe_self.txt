Author: Daniel Orbach
Date:  3/11/21
Notes: I made it so that the different dropdown menues are disabled/enabled at the right times for all routes.
       I did this by adding a prop selectedSequence which the component can use along with the other data it recives
       to determine if it should be enabled or not.

Title: Third Sequence Results
Author: Daniel Orbach

Notes:
       Made Changes to get_results so that the disease sequence compares only the data for the selected country
       Seeing a lot of repeated code in get_results. We should organize it a little better once we have everything finished


Title Fixed Slider Bug
Author: Daniel Orbach
Notes: Edidted App.js to fix the slider. Made it so that the change functions read the value directly from the slider instead 
       of from the event which may breakdown.


Title: Frontend year selection implementation take one 
Author: Daniel Orbach 
Notes:
       Front End is now passing the selected_year throughout the backend. Not all backend functions are using it yet however.
       For the first few api calls it appears as selected_year in the request.json. For get_results I have pulled it out it is in
       request in dict_dataa under the key Year i have created a variable to store it early in the method. 

Title: updated NTD specs to work for all years
Author: Destiny Walcott
Notes:
       - Added updates to flask_app.py. Modified all functions related to the NTD specification and impact score calculation, so that way it can work for all years
       - Added new spec_NTDs.py file to create new database tables for the spec NTD 2010 and 2013. I have structured the code in a way that simplifies the process to create new tables for future years
